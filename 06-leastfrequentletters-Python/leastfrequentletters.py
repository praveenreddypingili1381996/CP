# leastFrequentLetters(s) [20 pts]
# Write the function leastFrequentLetters(s), that takes a string s, and ignoring case (so "A" and "a" are treated 
# the same), returns a lowercase string containing the least-frequent alphabetic letters that occur in s, each 
# included only once in the result and then in alphabetic order. So:
# leastFrequentLetters("aDq efQ? FB'daf!!!") 
# returns "be". Note that digits, punctuation, and whitespace are not letters! Also note that seeing as we have not 
# yet covered lists, sets, maps, or efficiency, you are not expected to write the most efficient solution. Finally, 
# if s does not contain any alphabetic characters, the result should be the empty string ("")

def leastfrequentletters(s):
	# Your code goes here
	l=[]
	min=1
	s=s.lower()
	for i in s:
		if i not in l:
			if s.count(i)<= min:
				l.append(i)
			min=s.count(i)
	for i in l:
		print(i)
	pass
